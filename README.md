# Pandas Challenge

Using the information on the Heroes of Pymoli csv, I was able to analyze the data by creating various data frames. From those data summaries, the three following trends emerged.

1.	The most common age group is the 20- through 24-year-old group, which also buys significantly more items than any other       age group. This is important information when creating a marketing campaign.

2.	There are six times as many males buying items as females, which likely means that there are about that many more males       playing the game as females. However, females do buy slightly more expensive items on average - $4.47 to $4.07.

3.	The more expensive items, around in the $4 to $5 range, are bought more frequently than other items, with 3 of the top 5       items being in that range. If prices in that range are not a deterrent, it might be worthwhile to increase the price of       other items.
